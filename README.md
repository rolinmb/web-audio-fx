VST-Plugin like application using typescript and the Web Audio API; the user can select a local .mp3 file to preview with FX and then download the edited version.

TODO: troubleshoot output .wav file being unrecognizable/unreadable (may have to result to external npm libraries and building via webpack; may also migrate this project in general to another repo and move forward without typescript...)
